# SkyblockProfileChecker
A profile checker utilizing the Hypixel API to check the profiles of individual users.

This was originally created on the Hypixel forums, and the basis for it is still available there. However, much of it was quite disorganized and I ran into a few errors initially running it, along with the perfect conditions meaning errors could screw up the entire program. I rewrote a large part of the script and organized it so it works with any user now, just requiring your API.

# Installation

Download either the .exe or the .py from [the releases page](https:github.com/DocEmerald/SkyblockProfileChecker/Releases). It may say the files are not trusted, but you can click the up arrow followed by "keep" to download them anyway. If you don't trust it, take a look at the source code, it's pretty simple.
